The code I wrote only had two methods, but the generated code automatically
 has setters and getters for each variable, as well as a default constructor.
 The auto generated code has broken up each class into its own file, and 
 each class has its own toString() method. The umple plugin could be useful for
 planning out projects, as it provides a good framework to build upon. The
 plugin would be hard to use for intense programming, as it is difficult to
 add complex methods to the program. Umple is useful for beginning a project
 but would hinder the programmer once progress has been made, as it is not
 good for editing complex functions. All in all, I liked it although sometimes
 it was difficult and does not allow overriding the default get and set
 methods, which is good or bad depending on the situation.
